# Rick and Morty React

This is a [React](https://reactjs.org) app to visualize characters from Rick & Morty TV show. The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and we use Apollo Client to access the data avilable on [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com) website through [GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/).

On each push the code is aumaticaly deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)—using the addres https://rick-and-morty-react.netlify.com—and also on [Now](https://zeit.co/now)—under the address https://rick-reacts.now.sh. 

The initial requirements were very simple:
* display the characters with pagination;
* be able to filter by status, species and gender;
* be able to search a character by name;
* be able to sort the cards by name (ascendant and descendant).
